      <!-- CONTENT INDEX: 

*Template refs: 
  -Grabing elements from the DOM. Grab an input and element and give it the class active on click of a button

*Multiple component: 
  -Creating a component and using it inside App.vue

*Scoped and global CSS: 
  -Add global and modal specific styles to an app

*Props:
  -Passing data from the parent to child component. 
  -Passing the text that goes in the child component.
  -Style a component differently depending on its theme

*Emitting custom events: 
  -Show and hide a modal or any other component.
  -Use onClick calling a function that is not on the same component but in the parent component

*Click event modifiers: 
   -Close the modal only when the user clicks on the backdrop not on the modal itself
   -Add a special modification to the click event, like for example open a modal if the user clicks on a button and press the key alt at the same time

*Slots: 
   -Create the whole text that a reusable compononet should have by using <template>, instead passing props
  -Add a specific text to only one of the reusable components

*Challenge: create another modal: 
   -Use a component that was already created with another content but the same functionallity. In other words, make use of a resusable component

*Using Teleport: 
   -Render components in a div different that #app
